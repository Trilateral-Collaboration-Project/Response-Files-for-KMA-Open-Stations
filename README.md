# Response-Files-for-KMA-Open-Stations
This repository provides instrument response files for several KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration) seismic stations that are listed on IRIS but have no response information there.
The responses for active stations were downloaded directly from KMA’s domestic web service.
For closed or renamed stations, the response files were obtained from KIGAM’s archive in XML format and re-downloaded to make sure they are up to date.
